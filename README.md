# dynamic-coloured-petri-net

These models are simulated by using CPN tools
Petri net model one is example of a battery-powered system has 5 states, 5 enegy consumption sources
Petri net model two is example of a battery-powered system has 5 states, 5 enegy consumption sources and a workload that represent the average daily consumption for a a battery-powered device
Petri net model three is example of a battery-powered system has 7 states, 7 enegy consumption sources and a workload that represent the average daily consumption for a a battery-powered device
